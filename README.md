# Predictive Analytics using R
For each of the 50 states in the United States, the data set contains the number of arrests per 100,000 residents for each of three crimes: Assault, Murder, and Rape. We also record UrbanPop (the percent of the population in each state living in urban areas). Note that the variables are measured in different units; Murder, Rape, and Assault are reported as the number of occurrences per 100,000 people, and UrbanPop is the percentage of the stateâ€™s population that lives in an urban area.

The objective is to cluster different US states using crime statistics.
